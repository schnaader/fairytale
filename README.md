# Fairytale
modern lossless community archiver that features

* state of the art analysis of input data
* detection and transform / recompression of data to improve compression
* sorting input and arrange it in different streams
* deduplication across all streams and recursion levels
* applying different (best fit) compression algorithms on each stream
* storing compressed data in a modern archiver format

It offers great modularity so that any algorithm can be added to it
and enough flexibility to chose between fast, best practical or experimental state-of-the-art compression.
Fairytale is a dream of a next generation archiver and it is a work in progress

Releases/Binaries
-----------------

Please note that this is a very rough prototype that allows for testing of the pre-processing library.
It doesn't apply any compression right now.
